# Redux Continued

### Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Understand the key differences between state in `react` and state in `redux`
- Use `react-redux` to connect `react` and `redux`
- Use `redux` middleware to handle asynchronous actions

### Redux and React

To connect these two libraries we use another library called `react-redux` which gives us a few functions and components to connect redux state to react state. 

### connect

### mapStateToProps

### MapDispatchToProps

### <Provider></Provider>

### Async Redux with Redux Thunk

`npm install --save redux-middleware`

### React Router and Redux
