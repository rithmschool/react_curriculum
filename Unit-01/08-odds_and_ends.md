# Odds and Ends

### Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Validate properties of components using PropTypes
- Compare and contrast different kinds of components
- Understand the value and performance benefits of immutable data structures with react
- Define what `context` is and how it can be used to solve complex issues with state management

### PropTypes

[https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html)

### Types of Components

#### Container / Smart Components
#### Presentational / Dumb Components

```js
var Component = function (){
    return (
            <div>
                <h1>Hello!</h1>
            </div>
        )
}
```

#### Higher Order Components



### Immutability
